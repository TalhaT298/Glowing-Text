## How It Works

1. **Checkbox Interaction:**  
   Each letter is paired with a hidden checkbox. Clicking toggles the glowing effect.

2. **CSS Animations:**  
   The glowing effect uses `text-shadow` and `@keyframes` to create a smooth, animated glow.

3. **Responsive Styling:**  
   Letters are styled with flexbox for perfect alignment and spacing.
